## Project Description

FlaskML is a web application that leverages the Flask framework and the Deep Dream algorithm to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience for exploring the concept of neural network-based image generation.  The application allows users to upload their own images and generate dream-like versions of them using the Deep Dream algorithm.
It also provides a brief explanation of the concepts behind Deep Dream, including the concept of activation maximization through Gradient Ascent.

Deep Dream is a computer vision algorithm that generates highly abstract and dream-like images by amplifying the activations of the neurons in a deep convolutional neural network trained on image classification tasks. For a more detailed explanation visit <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html">the original Deep Dream blogpost</a>.


The application was built to utilize pre-trained deep learning models for the Deep Dream algorithm, implemented by <a href="https://github.com/gordicaleksa/pytorch-deepdream">Aleksa Gordic</a>. The user interface was designed for simplicity and ease of use, allowing users to quickly upload images and view the dreamified results.

It is not anywhere near perfect but I am working (and learning) to improve it while balancing the daily responsibilities I have.
